## About Alura Challenge Week 1

History
After some tests with prototypes made by the UX team of a company, the first version of a platform for sharing videos was requested. The platform should allow the user to assemble playlists with links to their favorite videos, separated by categories.

The frontend and UI teams are already working on the layout and screens. For the backend, the main features to be implemented are:

API with routes implemented according to the REST standard;
Validations made according to business rules;
Implementation of a database for information persistence;
Authentication service for access to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes.
We have a time period of 4 weeks to develop the project. In the first 3 we will have tasks to be done and the last week for adjustments or to complete pending tasks. Let's work with the agile development system, using Trello as follows:

The Ready to start column displays cards with elements not yet developed.
In the Developing column, there will be the elements that you are currently developing. When starting a task, you can move the card that contains the task to this column.
In Paused will be the elements that you started to develop, but had to stop for some reason.
Finally, the Completed column will have the elements already completed.
Trello is a single-use tool for you to track the progress of your activities, but it will not be evaluated.
